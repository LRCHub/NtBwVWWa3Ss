I took a walk around the world
To ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere
In the sands of time
Well, I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothin' I can do
Yeah
I watched the world float
To the dark side of the moon
After all, I knew it had to be
somethin' To do with you
I really don't mind what
happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend
at the end
If I go crazy
Then will you still call me
Superman
If I'm alive and well
Will you be there holdin' my
hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
You called me strong
You called me weak
But still your secrets I will
keep
You took for granted all the
times I never let you down
You stumbled in and
bumped your head
If not for me, then you'd be
dead
I picked you up and put you
Back on solid ground
If I go crazy
Then will you still call me
Superman
If I'm alive and well
Will you be there holdin' my
hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
No na na na na na no no
If I go crazy
Then will you still call me
Superman
If I'm alive and well
Will you be there
Holdin' my hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
Yeah
If I go crazy
Then will you still call me
Superman
If I'm alive and well
Will you be there holdin' my
hand
I'll keep you by my side with
My superhuman might
Kryptonite
Whoa hoo whoa hoo
whoa hoo
